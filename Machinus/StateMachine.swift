     This is handled by watching the `UIApplication.didEnterBackgroundNotification` and `UIApplication.willEnterForegroundNotification` notifications.
     When the app enters the background, the machine will note the current state then automatically transition to this state. When the app comes back to the foregraund it will transition back to the state it previously noted.

     The state assigned to this property will be configured as a global state to allow easy transitions so there is no need to add it to any of the other states as an allowed transition state. Transition barrier will also be ignore when executing these transitions.
